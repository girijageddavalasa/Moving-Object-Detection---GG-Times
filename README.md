# Moving-Object-Detection-with-OpenCV

# Overview

This project implements a basic motion detection system using OpenCV and Python. The application captures frames from a webcam, processes them to detect any motion in the scene, and highlights the moving objects. The primary goal is to demonstrate a simple and effective approach to motion detection using image processing techniques.

# Requirements
    Python 3.x
    OpenCV (cv2)
    Imutils (imutils)
    
You can install the required libraries using the following command:
      pip install opencv-python imutils
